# Weather-Guru
Weather Guru is a streamlined weather data and alert system hosted on IBM cloud using the publisher/subscriber model. It will provide clients with digestible qualitative and quantitative representations of past, present, and future weather data and predictions, as well as a severe weather event alert system to notify clients of potentially treacherous conditions. In this report, we will outline the requirements, documentation, implementation, and testing of our architecture. For our system, we are using a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) consisting of three services: a weather email alert service, historical weather data comparison service, and general weather forecast service. These services together will provide users with a complete blanket of baseline weather data to use in their day-to-day lives.
The weather email alert service will provide subscribers with a formatted html email alert, warning of severe weather events such as rain, hail, tornados, or thunderstorms. The alerts will outline details of the event such as the event type, duration, severity, and location. The historical weather data comparison service provides users with the ability to compare weather data between two subscribed cities. The general weather forecast service provides users with a representation of present weather data for a user's subscribed cities.
